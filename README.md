The scene demonstrates basic principles of 3D modeling, hierarchical transformations, and user interaction through sensors. The lamp features: 1. A movable base (via drag interaction) 2. A rotatable lamp arm (via click-and-rotate interaction) 3. Red material properties for visual styling --- ### **Key Components** #### 1. **World Metadata** - **Title**: "Untitled4" - **Creation Tool**: Built using Vivaty Studio (a legacy Web3D authoring tool by Media Machines) - **Navigation Settings**: - Avatar size optimized for walk-through navigation - Walk speed: 1 unit/sec - Built-in headlight enabled #### 2. **3D Structure** - **Base Component**: - Red cylindrical platform (`GeoCylinder1`) - Dimensions: Radius 0.1 units, Height 0.01 units - **Lamp Arm**: - Thin red cylinder (`GeoCylinder2`) - Dimensions: Radius 0.01 units, Height 0.3 units - Pivot point offset for realistic rotation #### 3. **Interaction System** - **Translation Control**: - `PlaneSensor` (`movelamp`) enables XY-plane dragging of the base - **Rotation Control**: - `SphereSensor` (`movefirstarm`) allows rotational manipulation of the lamp arm - **Event Routing**: ```vrml ROUTE movelamp.translation_changed TO dad_LAMPGROUP.set_translation ROUTE movefirstarm.rotation_changed TO dad_LAMPARM.set_rotation ``` #### 4. **View Configuration** - Initial viewpoint positioned at (0, 0.1, 1) - Field of View: 45 degrees (0.785 radians) --- ### **Technical Highlights** 1. **Hierarchical Transformations**: - Uses nested `Transform` nodes to create parent-child relationships between components - Lamp arm rotation center offset using `center` field for realistic movement 2. **Material Properties**: - Red diffuse color (`1 0 0`) - Low shininess (0.2) for matte appearance 3. **Sensor Implementation**: - `PlaneSensor` maps 2D mouse movements to 3D translations - `SphereSensor` converts drag motions into rotation quaternions --- ### **Educational Value** This code serves as a practical example for: - VRML scene graph structure - Interactive 3D component design - Sensor-event routing mechanics - Hierarchical transformation chains - Basic 3D material configuration --- ### **Usage Instructions** 1. Load in any VRML97-compliant viewer (e.g., FreeWRL, Cortona3D Viewer) 2. Interact with components: - Drag horizontally to move base - Click-and-drag to rotate lamp arm 3. Adjust parameters (e.g., sensor ranges, material colors) for customization --- ### **Suggested Research Applications** - Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) studies - 3D UI prototyping - VRML pedagogy - Legacy Web3D system analysis --- ### **Limitations & Extensions** *Current Limitations:* - Basic collision detection - Single-color material scheme - Fixed component dimensions *Potential Extensions:* 1. Add multiple interactive joints 2. Implement physics-based constraints 3. Introduce texture mapping 4. Add lighting/shadow effects --- Include this code as supplementary material for studies related to: - 3D interaction techniques - Web3D technologies - Legacy VR systems - 3D modeling education
